Lost Model Alarm for finding your lost aircraft.

Ultra Micro park flyer planes like the Hobbyzone Champ or Parkzone UM Corsair are light (~40g) and could be blown downwind and out of sight. That's what happened to my Champ.

LMA's on the market usually have 3-pin servo connectors but these RTF planes don't have a place to plug them.

So I decided to make an ultra-light, standalone LMA. Here it is in its various versions along with firmware.
